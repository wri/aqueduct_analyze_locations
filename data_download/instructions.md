Downloaded data comes in three flavors:
1. Annual Baseline
1. Monthly Baseline
1. Future Projection

# Annual Baseline

Identifiers:
**string_id**, string, contains a unique string for each geometry. Geometries are the union of hydrological basins, provinces and groundwater aquifers. The string_id is a combination of pfaf_id-gid_1-aqid. See the description of those columns.  
**aq30_id**, numerical, unique identifier.  
**pfaf_id**, numerical, six digit Pfafstetter code for the hydrological basins.  
**gid_1**, string, identifier for sub-national units based on the GADM dataset. It Iso A3 country code, followed by numeric values separated by underscores for each sub-national unit.   
**aqid**, numerical, identifier for groundwater Aquifers based on WHYMAP.   

Extra identifiers:
**gid_0**, string, ISO A3 country name based on GADM. See GADM for more information.   
**name_0**, string, National or political entity name based on GADM. See GADM for more information.
