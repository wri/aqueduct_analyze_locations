# Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas | Analyze locations instructions

The Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas allows users to import files with coordinates or addresses. This repo holds the sample excel files and instructions.

## Export format
After analyzing the locations, users can export the results. The export should contain **all** the results:

1. Monthly.  
1. Future Projections. 

The format of the output data depends on whether coordinates or addresses have been used as input.
